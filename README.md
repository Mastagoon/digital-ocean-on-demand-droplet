# digital-ocean-on-demand-droplet
programatically spinup or destroy a digital ocean droplet.

# How it works
This project uses the [Digital Ocean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/) to create and delete droplets.
You can also use it to backup and restore the server state, check this [Discordjs Example](examples/with-discordjs)
